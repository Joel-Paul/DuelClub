# DuelClub
DuelClub is an in-development proof-of-concept that aims to demonstrate how the duelling sytem in [Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery](http://www.harrypotterhogwartsmystery.com/) could be improved.

HP: HM utilises a simple rock/paper/scissors minigame to emulate duelling, however this is repetitious and boring.

I have compiled a list of what I believe to be negative factors in the original game:
- Very dependent on output randomness.
- Little strategy involved.
  - AI is more or less unpredictable, so players can't plan out attacks because it's random.
- A large amount of the spells are obsolete; why would you use a weaker spell over a stronger one?
- The stats of each spell are softly hidden, making it tedious to plan out moves.

This project aims to create a fun duelling experience that doesn't stray too far from the style of the original game.
